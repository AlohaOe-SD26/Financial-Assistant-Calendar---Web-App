## 🎯 Combined Finances Quick Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Individual Profiles
Each person creates their own profile with:
- Their income
- Their expenses (including their portion of shared costs)
- Their assets

### Step 2: Combine
1. Click "Combined Finances"
2. Select 2+ profiles
3. Click "Next: Review Items"

### Step 3: Merge Shared Expenses
**✅ Check these to merge:**
- Rent/Mortgage (if living together)
- Utilities (if shared)
- Groceries (if shared food budget)
- Any other shared costs

**❌ Leave unchecked (keep separate):**
- Individual car payments
- Personal credit cards
- Individual subscriptions
- Personal spending

### Step 4: Create & Save
1. Name your combined profile
2. Click "Create Combined Profile"
3. Export it as backup
4. Done!

## 📊 Understanding Merged Items

When you merge items, the amounts **ADD TOGETHER**:

**Example:**
```
Person A: Rent $1,500
Person B: Rent $1,500
Merged:   Rent $3,000 (Combined)
```

This is correct because:
- Total household rent is $3,000
- Shared by both people
- Shows accurate total expense

**For separate items:**
```
Person A: Car Payment $300 (Person A)
Person B: Car Payment $400 (Person B)
Not merged: Each shown separately
```

This is correct because:
- Each person has their own car
- Not a shared expense
- Individual responsibility

## 💾 Data Storage & Backup
